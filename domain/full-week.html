        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my time thinning out more and more and my energy levels tested
            each day by continuous physical effort and
            multiple life events (health and family issues happened all during May), I struggled harder than ever to
            release
            new content each day and not always the quality degree of the content was good. Sometimes it was less than
            good,
            some others was mediocre and I apologize to the writers whose articles I couldnâ€™t match with my
            contributions.

            office are a lack of motivation to get started and a fear that a goal will be too overwhelming.</p>
